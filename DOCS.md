Here I developed the chat application using HTML,CSS,JavaScript, Node.js and socket.io.

To run the chat application you need to start the server and make it listen on the port 5000

Install Socket.IO packages by running the following command - npm install socket.io

use the following command in terminal - node index.js

Now open and type the following link in the web browser - http://localhost:5000

here you can see the chat application where we get two chat boxes and we can send text messages from one user to another.
